# Cursor Rules

## Language and Communication
- **User Communication**: Always communicate with the user in Chinese (中文)
- **All Other Content**: Use English for everything else, including:
  - Git commit messages
  - Code comments and documentation
  - Code review comments
  - Task plans and todos
  - Error messages in code
  - Variable names, function names, and code structure
  - README and other documentation files
  - Configuration files and rules

## Git Configuration
- Always use non-interactive mode for git operations
- Use flags like `--yes`, `--no-verify`, `--no-edit`, etc. when needed to avoid interactive prompts
- Never use interactive git commands that require user input

## Code Standards
- Write all code, comments, and documentation in English
- Only the conversation with the user should be in Chinese
- Maintain consistency: codebase language is English, communication language is Chinese
